# Portfolio builder with graphql

This project was to get uesd to and practice with GraphQL, a query language to retrieve data from a database. Github has a GraphQL api built in to query someone's github profile and their activity. With this api, I created a simple app that read out your repositories and puts them into a nice template to show to you fellow developers.

## Install
Clone this repository and run `npm install`, then you can visit (`localhost:3000`)[localhost:3000] and fill in your github username to generate your personal github page.
